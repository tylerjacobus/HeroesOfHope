# Study guide for Heroes of Hope
[The Study Guide](https://tylerjacobus.github.io/heroesofhope/)  
I created this site in high school. I had been volunteering with Girl Rising for a couple of years and learned more about the issues Girl Rising works on including the connections between girlsâ€™ education and climate change. I had the chance to meet Ayo Solanke and learn more about her graphic novel. I learned a lot from her book and from meeting her and I thought it would be great to have a learning guide to go along with the book for other high school students like me. I used Javascript and HTML to create this website.
