	Today, even though girls and women are underrepresented in both STEM careers and in governmental leadership roles, there are millions of women who are using their education to help address climate change, climate justice and the world’s transition to a clean energy economy. Many of them have had to overcome major barriers to get their education and nearly all of them have had to face gender discrimination, but they are leading the way in policy, activism, local solutions and technology. In Heroes of Hope, Idara talks about her admiration for Queen Amina, known as the first woman leader in a male-dominated world in the 16th century. Idara goes on to be a leader herself. Today, women leaders in climate change are helping to create a fairer and more sustainable world for everyone. Meet some of these leaders here.
