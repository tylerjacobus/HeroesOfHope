<p> In the graphic novel, Heroes of Hope, Ayomide Solanke tells the story of a teenage girl who was forced to stop going to school because of the effects of climate change in her region of southern Nigeria. Climate change is affecting all of us, but around the world, it is impacting girls more severely.

Each year, tens of millions of people across the globe have to flee their homes because of floods, storms, droughts, and other weather-related disasters. The World Bank estimates that the three regions of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia will generate 143 million climate migrants by 2050.  Women and girls bear most of the burden. According to the UN, 80% of people displaced by climate change effects are women and girls.. This is true in Nigeria and other areas of Central Africa where there has been persistent drought and 90% of Lake Chad has dried up.  It is also true in the United States. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina disproportionately impacted women of color.

Because of existing gender inequality, women and girls face additional dangers related to climate change disasters. Women and girls who are displaced by climate change events often face the risks of gender-based violence, trafficking, and exploitation. The UN Environment Programme estimates that there is a 20-30% increase in trafficking after natural disasters. Women and girls who have been displaced can also face far more restrictive options due to gender bias.  For example, they may have restrictions on land and property rights, they may face restrictions in their movement and they may have few options to earn a living.

Women produce most of the world’s food and bear most of the burden of securing food and water for their families.  In many countries agriculture is the most important work sector for women. During periods of drought and erratic rainfall, women had to work many more hours to secure income and resources for their families. This puts added pressure on girls, who often have to leave school to help their mothers manage the increased burden. Despite women and girls bearing the responsibility for food and water security they do not have equal rights in this area.  Men own the majority of the world’s property, and women have historically held less than 10% of all legal and legislative positions in the field of environment, natural resources and energy.
